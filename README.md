# WishList App

The **WishList App** is a feature-rich Android application developed using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**. It allows users to create, update, and manage a list of wishes with a clean and intuitive interface. Backed by a robust Room database implementation, the app ensures reliable data persistence. This project is ideal for understanding advanced Android concepts, including MVVM architecture, state management, navigation, and database handling.

## Key Features

### 1. **Add a Wish**
- Users can easily add a new wish by providing a title and description.
- Input fields are validated to ensure both title and description are non-empty.

### 2. **View All Wishes**
- Displays all the saved wishes in a scrollable list.
- Uses a `LazyColumn` for optimized rendering of large data sets.

### 3. **Edit a Wish**
- Existing wishes can be updated seamlessly.
- Pre-fills the input fields when editing a wish for better user experience.

### 4. **Delete a Wish**
- Users can delete wishes they no longer need, ensuring a clutter-free list.

### 5. **Navigation**
- Smooth navigation between screens using **Jetpack Navigation**.
- Screens include:
  - Home Screen
  - Add/Edit Wish Screen

### 6. **MVVM Architecture**
- Implements Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture for separation of concerns.
- ViewModel ensures UI and data logic are decoupled.

### 7. **Room Database**
- Persists user data locally using **Room Database**.
- DAO (Data Access Object) methods handle operations like add, update, delete, and fetch wishes.
- Schema includes:
  - Wish table with `id`, `title`, and `description` fields.

### 8. **Jetpack Compose**
- Fully developed using **Jetpack Compose** for modern UI development.
- Composables include:
  - `AppBarView`: Custom AppBar for navigation.
  - `WishTextField`: Reusable text input fields.

### 9. **Snackbar Notifications**
- Provides instant feedback using **Snackbar** for actions like adding or updating a wish.

### 10. **State Management**
- Utilizes `MutableStateFlow` and `State` for efficient state management.
- Ensures real-time UI updates when the data changes.
